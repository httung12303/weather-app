# Weather Web App
## Introduction
This is project is a exercise from The Odin Project using WeatherAPI.
## API
I initially used OpenWeatherAPI but later went for WeatherAPI because its free plan consists of an hourly weather forecast instead of the 3 hour period one from OpenWeatherAPI.

If you need more information, I highly recommend WeatherAPI and OpenWeatherAPI for simplicity. Also, WeatherAPI provides a free, comprehensive set of weather icons 
## What I learnt
Building this project gave me a closer look at how to use API, and more importantly, Promises and asynchronous JavaScript. 

On the other hand, it was an opportunity to revisit topics like linting, npm and webpack, which was very tedious to manually set up every project. Therefore, I created templates for webpack and eslint in my [repos](https://github.com/httung12303/webpack-project-template.git), which includes some more resources that I find myself use repeatedly.
